I run a real estate & property management company in Tokyo since 2006.  Nice to meet you and thank you for checking my profile and listings.

I have been using AirBnB since 2011 for my travels in Europe and had a really great time in all the places I stopped over. I really love European cities, food, wine and cheeese!  

Since this website do not support monthly rental apartment my listing you can see online is getting small. However still I manage several different apartments as always and welcoming monthly stayers from all over the world. If you plan to stay in Tokyo over a month please feel free to contact me. I have many different apartments in several areas of Tokyo city. 

As I had no trouble and really enjoyed staying at AirBnB hosts' homes, I decided to provide a similar and even better service in Tokyo. Therefore, I hope my apartments will provide you a pleasant and comfortable stay during your travel to thrilling Tokyo!

If you have any questions or inquiries during your stay, I would be happy to help you.

I have been in the shared economy community for over 3 years and have come to learn a lot about how it work",none,"Hatagaya is a great neighborhood located 4 minutes by train train from Shinjuku (15-20 minutes walking). It is extremely lively by any international standards but not as crowded a Shinjuku. It features dozens of family restaurants, convenience stores and bars open 24X7.","",Getting in from the Narita International Airport is a breeze where I recommend you take either the Narita Express (a.k.a NEX) or the Limousine bus to Shinjuku and then a cab for about 10 minutes to the apartment (The cab should be between 15 and 20 USD for up to 4 passengers).  If you are traveling from Haneda it is even faster. If you a family that has between 2 and 4 members I recommend taking a cab from Haneda Airport directly. This would be around 90 USD with tolls under a new fixed-price program. Otherwise you can also take the Limousine bus to Shinjuku and then cab it to the apartment from Shinjuku. On the transport front this apartment is serviced by Toei Shinjuku; where the closest train station is Hatagaya located 6 minutes away walking from the apartment:    Train times to common tourist's spots from Hatagaya Station include:  Shinjuku: 4 minutes  Yoyogi: 10 minutes  Shibuya: 17 minutes (There is also a bus that gets you to Shibuya in 15 minutes)  Roppongi: 18 minutes  Iwamot,"This 2 bedroom apartment is entirely yours to enjoy (i.e.: NO sharing with other families).
